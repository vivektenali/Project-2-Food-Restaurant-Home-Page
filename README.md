# Food Restaurant Home Page

Second HTML+CSS project. A simple Food Restaurant Home Page.

As I have already done my [Project1](https://street-style-landing-project-1.netlify.app/),
now for project 2 I have a better understanding on how to target the specific elements and 
play with them.

This Food Restaurant Home Page was a simple one.
